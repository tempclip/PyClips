# Twitch Clip Batch Downloader  
![example-gif](https://github.com/amiechen/twitch-batch-loader/blob/master/example.gif)

### Pre-Install:

1) Get a twitch `Client ID` by registering a twitch app [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create).
Once finished, copy the `Client ID`. You will need it to run the script.

2) Install python 3 on your machine if you haven't.

### Usage:

1) Install python packages
```
pip install requests
```

2) Delete the example clips in `clips.txt` and the ones your want. Put each URL on it's own line. No commas or anything like that.

3) Then run the batchloader script with your new Client Id
```
cd twitch-batch-loader
python batchloader.py <YOUR AWESOME CLIENT ID>
```

Voil√†! once you see the finished message in your terminal, check the `downloads` folder in this repo and you should see the videos there.
